# Journal Reviews
*Recommended Additional Work*

## Goals
Part of your final project is to write up a "final paper." In order to really understand how people write papers, we should read as many as possible and understand how they are written, what works and what doesn't, so that way you have something upon leaving the course that looks and sounds professional that you'd want to share with future employers.

## Reading Journal Articles
Data Science is highly considered an _academic_ job: top data scientists are MS and PhD graduates in Computer Science, Applied Math, or Computational Statistics, and many continue publishing papers about their practices. That said, reading academic papers can be taxing and difficult when not read effectively as "good academic readers," something many of us probably haven't done since college or high school.

The three reading strategies that always work best for me are as follows:
### Talking to text
Print out your paper and read the paper out loud instead of reading silently. While you read the paper, also say out loud anything that you're thinking about, and anytime you say something that wasn't written, write it down near that area. This works best with "peer reading," where one person narrates and talks out loud, and the other person writes down everything on the article. This can get split up.

### Keep track of what you know and don't know
I also like to use two highlighters as I read: One color for stuff that is important that I understand, and the other color for stuff that sounds important but I don't know. This makes it easier to refer back to the article and find everything I didn't know so I can look it up and learn about it. If you say something while talking to the text like, "I don't know what this means," it's a good candidate for that second highlighter!

### Ask Questions at all levels
Don't be afraid of asking high level questions like, "What is this?" or making statements like, "This reminds me of my grandma's cooking." But at the same time, push yourself to be analytical and also ask questions like, "What if they considered a different sampling rate?" or "Have they considered if the audience of this data is too specific and doesn't generalize the model well enough?" The high level information are typically more memorizable and easier to refer to, while the low level can improve the depth at which you read.

## Writing Journal Reviews
Once each other week you'll be writing a journal review. Journal Reviews generally have the following sections:

Objective/Abstract: What is the paper about, and what was the goal of the paper?
Hypothesis: Where any hypotheses made within the paper before the work began? If so, what was it? What did you think about it?

Style: Who was the audience of the paper, and how could that get figured out? (Some data science papers are not written for other data scientists, but more targeted towards the applied section of the paper, ie Sociologists, etc).

Methods: What methodologies did the paper use to approach its objective? How well did they work?

Conclusions: Overall assessment of the paper. This is generally broken into parts of what you thought about the material you read, do you think it was well written or poorly written, how well did it answer the questions it was looking at, and did you have any follow up questions about the data, methodologies, etc.

Please submit journal reviews as a markdown (.md) file to Schoology (or submit a gist.github link), using proper markdown syntax.
Here are two great guides for writing markdown files, and a great markdown editor I recommend (and many at the GA use themselves)
