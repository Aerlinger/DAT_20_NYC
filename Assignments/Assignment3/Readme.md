# Data Mining Algorithms Readthru
*Due Date: 3/26/2015*

## Objectives

* familiarize yourself with the common data mining problems and algorithms
* focus and learn about one in particular

## Assignment

Read through Oracle's top level page on [data mining algorithms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/odm-techniques-algorithms-097163.html). Keep track of words you don't understand, recognize, heard before, etc.

Under "algorithms," pick one link and read through the text. in a markdown file, write up the following:

* What was the name of the algorithm you read about?
* What data problem does it solve? (listed under Technique on previous page)
* In layman's terms, what does the algorithm do? Even if you aren't sure, that's okay! Just try your best--we're not looking for perfect answers.
* Come up with up to three applications of this algorithm in business. Try relating it to your own job or line of work, your other data interests, or what have you.

Do make sure that the link you clicked through is about the algorithm! Some of Oracle's links are broken or incorrect.

Submit this markdown to your folder in the students repository Github or
