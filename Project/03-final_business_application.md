# Unit Project 3: Project 2 Update and Business Application
*Due Date TBD.  Brief presentations in class.*

### After the project, you will be able to:

### Contents of your submission include

* Presentation
* "Client-Facing" Notebook
* Developer Notebook

#### Presentation

* Each student will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present their project.
* On Tuesday night, students will post a link to their client-facing notebook on the 'issues' page of the repository, so other students can follow along.  The title of the issue will be the title of the repository. As a reminder, ipynb file links can be entered into http://nbviewer.ipython.org/ for rendering to html.
* Rather than slides, students will show images and text from their 'client facing notebook' as a visual aide.
* There will be no Q&A, but audience and students are encouraged to leave comments for their colleagues in the issues.

#### Client-Facing Notebook

A clean notebook notebook with text, code and images which could be understood by a reader such as yourself prior to taking this course.  Include as many images as you can, provided you include a brief explanation of them or they are self explanatory.  Feel free to include code, but ensure that it is explained, _briefly_, via text.  There is no need to include all of the code, as that will be present in the developer notebook.

Include the following sections:

##### Motivation

* A paragraph or two describing in words what the work you're describing.
* Feel free to include any images or plots that help.

##### Data Acquisition and Exploration
* How did you acquire and clean the data?
* How did you describe your dataset?  Include all exploratory plots.  What was interesting about it?

### Analyses Performed

#### Analysis 1

* Question Asked
* Analysis Performed
* Explanation of Analysis
* Results
* Explanation of Results

#### Analysis 2 (etc.)

### Conclusions

Recap the motivation and overall results

### Next Steps

What are some follow up analyses that might be interesting?

### Resources

Include links to your developer's notebook and any other sources that you'd like.

#### Developer Notebook

The developer notebook includes the full code and output of your work, in an organized fashion.  This can serve as a reference for yourself, for other coders, and for future students, as an example or 'how to' for doing the analyses that you completed or worked towards.

It should include markdown headers for each section, and all code should be commented or explained with markdown cells.

Feel free to err on the side of inclusion, in terms of code snippets, plots and explanation.

You might want to include (paste in) the headings from your client-facing notebook as well.

Submit the link to the notebook on the [course submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/qLHIjZadnp)
