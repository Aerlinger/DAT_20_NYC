## General Assembly Data Science Course: Example Student Projects

This repo is a collection of example projects from students in General Assembly's part-time Data Science course. Rather than being a comprehensive collection of projects, its purpose is to give incoming students a sense of the variety and scope of past projects, and to spur their thinking for their own projects.
