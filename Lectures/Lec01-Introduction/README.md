###Welcome to GA

**GA Intro**:
A GA Producer will give the course introduction hitting on the following points before turning the class over to the instructor.

[lesson_slides](lec01.pptx)

### In-Class Exercises
You will be using the terminal and an open R session for the in class exercises as outlined in the slides.  


**Objective: Navigating the filesylstem on the UNIX Command line**

- Explore various unix commands as outlined in Section III of slides
- Use a simple text file to explore some of the grep/awk commands [pace.txt]()

**Objective: Explore & visualize data using R and ggplot2.**

- Please be sure to prepare the tools you need. Students should have already installed R and ggplot2 (as part of the pre-work)but you may need to go over this in class. 

- Refer to the included [R session](Exercise/Lesson1_R_Session.txt) for reference located in the [Exercise](./Exercise) folder.


### Homework Assignment  
Ask students to create their own GitHub account so that they can centralize and share their solutions to assignments in the course.
