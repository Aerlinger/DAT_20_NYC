      "* c (continue): Finishes the debugging session. If there are more breakpoints (or if your set_trace() code gets called again before the request finishes) then you will get back to the debugger, otherwise the requests will complete back to the browser.\n",
      "* s (step): Goes down into the next level of execution (presumably a different file). You can follow your code through Django’s internals this way. This is really good for finding bugs and getting a better understanding about how Django works.\n",

      "* u (up): Allows you to go up one level in the backtrace.\n",
      "* d (down): Allows you to go down one level in the backtrace. These two commands allow you to see where you came from, and what variables were called where. This lets you see how the state ended up the current way that it did, which is great for figuring out how to fix it. :)\n",
      "* locals(): This isn’t a debugger function, but it is really handy for seeing what is in the current scope that you can muck around with. locals().keys() is really nice too just to see the variables that are there, because request tends to pollute the locals() command."
