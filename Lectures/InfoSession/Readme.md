### Things I wish I would have known before I become a data scientist

1. Human Learning before machine learning

- Humans are great pattern recognizers and can see obvious relationships
in data even the most complex algorithms cannot. Always understand and
have conceptual 'ownership' of your data before applying algorithmic
methods.

### Examples: 
  - Pass rate for Poland's matura (High school exit exam)
  - Foursquare's 'pulse' visualization
  - Minard infographic of Napoleon's march
  - 

2. Understand the "abstraction layers" that exist within the
   organization or company you're working in. You'll need to interface
with many of them.

- Engineering
- Operations
- Managment/stakeholders

* Soft skills matter as much as hard skills.

3. Establish consistent definitions, vocabulary, and semantic
   ontologies, both in speech and in code. 

- Database tables/columns
- Variable names

4. Keep it simple, always.

Just like Point #1, but worth a slide of it's own. Don't try prove
something by making a complicated model or workflow. Your time and your
colleagues time is precious.

5. Don't repeat yourself, also means not doing the same thing twice

- Again, your time is precious!

6. If you're deploying a model, Know the production code!
