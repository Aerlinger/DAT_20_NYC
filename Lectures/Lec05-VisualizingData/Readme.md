## Lecture 5: Using Visuals to Explore and Represent Quantitative Information


### Learning Objectives:

- Apply knowledge of Pandas to reshape data for various types of
visualizatons
- Understand the various types of data
- Understand the relationship between the format and structure of a data set
and how it can be represented visually
- Best practices for visualizing data
- How to avoid common pitfalls
- Strategies for handling overplotting
- Know how to plot in more than three dimensions

### Lecture Outline

1. Recap of last lecture
1. Review of Pandas by Example
  - Querying
  - Subsetting
  - Imputation
  - Conversion
  - Grouping and Aggregation
  - Summary Statistics
1. Basic plotting in Pandas using the `plot` function
1. Why visualize?
  - *Understanding* and *Exploring* your dataset 
    - Finding patterns: Some features and patterns are obvious to humans
that can't be reproduced even by the best algorithm.
    - This is because of semantics - What something *means* in the data
  - *Communicating* your dataset: Reducing complexity is key
    - Business Intelligence
1. Simple Examples:
  - Poland's high school exit exam
  - Napoleon's March
  - Visualizing the Yield Curve
  - Foursquare
  - In Class: Anscombe's Quartet
   
1. Understand the various types of Data
  - Numerical:
    - Continuous
    - Discrete 
    - "Binned" data
    - Time Series
  - Categorical
  - Nominal
  - Identifier (e.g. Row number, Column name)
1. Understand various types of plots and how the relate to the format,
shape, and type of data being plotted
  - How we define our axes depends on:
    - Dimension of the data
    - Type of data
    - Structure of the data (hierarchical columns? Grouping? Column
relationships?)

1. Understand the relationship between the format and structure of a data set
and how it can be represented visually
1. Apply strategies for effectively communicating data through visuals
  - Handling overplotting (Jittering, alpha blending)
