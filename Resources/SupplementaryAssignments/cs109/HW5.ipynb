      "**(c)** Recall from the lecture that there is a tradeoff between the bias and the variance of a classifier. We want to choose a model that generalizes well to unseen data. With a **high-variance** classifier we run the risk of **overfitting** to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, classifier with a **high bias** typically produce simpler models that tend to **underfit** the training data, failing to capture important regularities. \n",

This parameter is set to `None` per default, but it also provides an `auto` mode, which uses the values of the labels Y to **automatically adjust weights** inversely proportional to class frequencies. As done in sub-problem 4(b), **draw the decision boundaries** for two SVM classifiers. **Use `C=1.0`, and `gamma=1.0`** for **both** models, but for the first SVM set `class_weigth` to **`None`**, and for the second SVM set `class_weigth` to **`'auto'`**. (Hint: `None` is a keyword in Python, whereas the `'auto'` is a String and needs the quotation marks.) "
